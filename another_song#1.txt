The times were hard and I was running
I could feel my chance was coming
Another time, another place
A pillow filled with frozen tears
See the gates, a distant fire
Shows the way, to my desire
Laying down my heart for you
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue
I know that I'll never die on love
But I'll never get enough
Oh, I got no time to lose
On my avenue to a jet airliner
Avenue to my broken dreams
My avenue to a jet airliner
Like an old old movie-scene
My avenue to a jet airliner
Brings me back to the dreams I loved
